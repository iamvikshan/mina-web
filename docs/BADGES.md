## 💡 Tips for Guardians

### **How to Maximize Rank Growth**

1. **Join communities you care about** - Only take ADMIN roles where you'll be active
2. **Deploy strategically** - Focus on communities that align with your interests
3. **Maintain quality** - Better to manage fewer realms well than many poorly
4. **Stay active** - Inactive deployments may be removed over time

### **How to Earn Achievements Faster**

1. **First Watch**: Deploy immediately after connecting Discord
2. **Squad Leader**: Deploy to 2 realms on day one
3. **Dawn Warrior**: Set alarm and login before 6 AM once
4. **Midnight Sentinel**: Login right after midnight once
5. **Network Guardian**: Gradually deploy to quality communities
6. **Living Legend**: Long-term goal—grow naturally over months

### **Achievement Hunting Strategy**

- ✅ Start with time-based achievements (easy one-time actions)
- ✅ Focus on deployment milestones next
- ✅ Save optional achievements for later (require specific conditions)
- ✅ Don't rush—achievements are permanent, ranks change
